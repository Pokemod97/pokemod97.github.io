## Overall 
This is the place where I'll post a review of the stuff I have done the past week. This week started officially on Thursday after my last AP test. I consider it a failure so far. Thursday went ok to start but I found myself not working after the morning. The rest of the week failed. Saturday I exercised in the morning and that threw off my schedule but I felt better exercising first.

## The Method 
This is the place were I talk about the methods I use to achieve my goals and whether or no it is effective.
As seen on step 8 after noon I don't really do work except to workout. I need to fix that. I'm using a habit tracker on notion to maintain the habits I'm trying to build which is exercise, sleep, meditation, and journaling. I think I'm going to drop journaling. I have started carrying a notebook and pen in my pocket.

2. Make Bed
3. Take Shower
4. Get Dressed
5. Eat Breakfast 
6. Brush Teeth and Do Drops for practice
7. Sit down and work
8. 12:00 Failure time

### Sleep 
Sleep is an important part of maintaining a schedule. I'm using AutoSleep and AutoWake apple watch apps. I'm use a smart light to turn down the light an hour before bed. Reading on my kindle paperwhite to read instead of screens. I practice meditation right before bed. I find using the AutoSleep lights off feature a way to say that I'm going to bed and I'm going to sleep.
