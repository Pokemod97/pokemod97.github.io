# Introduction and Context
This is a playlist of media items that were in my feeds while I was taking Social Justice and Criminal Justice. I collected several podcasts because I listen to a lot of podcasts and it was the media that was revelent of the class. However, I then discovered that variety of media was an importance piece of the work. As a result I have created a large honorable mentions category that mostly covers the podcasts which didn't make the cut.

# The Playlist
##  Abortion Was Illegal. This Secret Group Defied the Law | Retro Report 
{% include video id="b8NMhEcyJ_I" provider="youtube" %}
Abortion is the only medical treatement in which done properly and by a doctor in accordance to the best known medical knowledge at the time is just as likely to land the doctor and patient in trouble with the criminal justice system.  This video covers a group of women who inspite of not being doctors and abortion being illegal preformed safe abortions at great risk to themselves.
## Junk Science and the American Criminal Justice System 
> Innocence Project attorney M. Chris Fabricant presents an insider’s journey into the heart of a broken, racist system of justice and the role junk science plays in maintaining the status quo.
This [book](https://www.amazon.com/Science-American-Criminal-Justice-System-ebook/dp/B09MTZ6Q13/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1693805487) covers a lot of the ways our criminal justice relies on experts and fake science to convict people. I'm still in the middle of reading this one. I heard about it on this podcast where the Author talked about it with Cara Santa Maria.
